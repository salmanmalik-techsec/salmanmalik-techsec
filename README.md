<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª My Projects:</h2>

- <b>Azure / Cloud Cybersecurity Projects:</b>
  - [Creating a Live SOC / HoneyNet](https://github.com/salmanmalik-techsec/Cloud-SOC)
    - **Tools:** Azure, Microsoft Sentinel, Log Analytics Workspace
    - **Purpose:** Built a mini honeynet to simulate real-world cyber attacks and ingest logs for detection and response using Sentinel.
    - **Metrics Before Hardening:**
      - Observed 348 security incidents and 10 security alerts over a 24-hour period in an insecure environment. 
      - Identified 843 malicious network flows allowed into the honeynet.
      - Logged 19,470 Windows Security Events and 3,028 Linux Syslog entries.
    - **Metrics After Hardening:**
      - Achieved 0 security incidents and 0 security alerts over a 24-hour period after implementing security controls.
      - Reduced Windows Security Events to 8,778 and Linux Syslog entries to just 25, demonstrating a significant decrease in suspicious activity.
- <b>Network Security Projects:</b>
  - [Secure VPN Configuration for Home Network](https://github.com/salmanmalik-techsec/Secure-VPN-Configuration)
    - **Project Overview:**
      - Configured secure VPN connections using Flint 2 and Beryl AX GL-MT3000 routers to establish a secure home network.
      - Ensured encrypted communication between home network devices and external networks, providing enhanced security.
    - **Key Features:**
      - Implemented a home-based VPN that allows remote, secure access to the home network from external devices.
      - Utilized both hardware and software firewalls to control and manage traffic, ensuring only trusted devices can access the network.
    - **Tools and Technology Used:**
      - Flint 2 and Beryl AX GL-MT3000 routers for VPN configuration.
      - Managed VPN traffic via OpenVPN and WireGuard protocols to ensure secure connectivity.
    - **Security Enhancements:**
      - Applied firewall rules to block unauthorized traffic and prevent potential breaches.
      - Enabled network segmentation for more secure and efficient traffic management across devices.
